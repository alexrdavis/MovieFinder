# Movie Finder
JavaFX program to search for movies in a table, find the shelf number they belong to, and allow users to mark the movie as borrowed.

# Problem It Solves:
The program was created for a user who owns over 800 movies and found it difficult to keep track of them all and recall when a movie was lent out. They wanted a simple solution that allowed them to see what movies they own, easily access them and put them back in the correct location.
